arogon-pool
====================


#### Requirements
* Coin daemon(s) (find the coin's repo and build latest version from source)
* simplewallet (Bytecoin/Forknote v1.1.11).  Do NOT use Forknote 2.0.0, since it's in alpha
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) v0.10+ ([follow these installation instructions](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager))
* [Redis](http://redis.io/) key-value store v2.6+ ([follow these instructions](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart))
* libssl required for the node-multi-hashing module
  * For Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev`
```bash
sudo apt-get install git build-essential redis-server libboost1.55-all-dev nodejs-dev nodejs-legacy npm cmake libssl-dev
```


#### 1) Downloading & Installing


Clone the repository and run `npm update` for all the dependencies to be installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arogon-project/arogon-pool/ pool
cd pool
npm update
```


#### 2) Start the pool

```bash
node init.js
```

The file `config.json` is used by default but a file can be specified using the `-config=file` command argument, for example:

```bash
node init.js -config=config_backup.json
```

This software contains four distinct modules:
* `pool` - Which opens ports for miners to connect and processes shares
* `api` - Used by the website to display network, pool and miners' data
* `unlocker` - Processes block candidates and increases miners' balances when blocks are unlocked
* `payments` - Sends out payments to miners according to their balances stored in redis


By default, running the `init.js` script will start up all four modules. You can optionally have the script start
only start a specific module by using the `-module=name` command argument, for example:

```bash
node init.js -module=api
```

[Example screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/SEgrI3b.png) of running the pool in single module mode with tmux.


#### 3) Host the front-end

Simply host the contents of the `website_example` directory on file server capable of serving simple static files.


Edit the variables in the `website_example/config.js` file to use your pool's specific configuration.
Variable explanations:

```javascript

/* Must point to the API setup in your config.json file. */
var api = "http://poolhost:8117";

/* Pool server host to instruct your miners to point to.  */
var poolHost = "poolhost.com";

/* IRC Server and room used for embedded KiwiIRC chat. */
var irc = "irc.freenode.net/#forknote";

/* Contact email address. */
var email = "support@poolhost.com";

/* Market stat display params from https://www.cryptonator.com/widget */
var cryptonatorWidget = ["DSH-BTC", "DSH-USD", "DSH-EUR"];

/* Download link to cryptonote-easy-miner for Windows users. */
var easyminerDownload = "https://github.com/zone117x/cryptonote-easy-miner/releases/";

/* Used for front-end block links. */
var blockchainExplorer = "http://chainradar.com/{symbol}/block/{id}";

/* Used by front-end transaction links. */
var transactionExplorer = "http://chainradar.com/{symbol}/transaction/{id}";

/* Any custom CSS theme for pool frontend */
var themeCss = "themes/default-theme.css";

```

#### 4) Customize your website

The following files are included so that you can customize your pool website without having to make significant changes
to `index.html` or other front-end files thus reducing the difficulty of merging updates with your own changes:
* `custom.css` for creating your own pool style
* `custom.js` for changing the functionality of your pool website


Then simply serve the files via nginx, Apache, Google Drive, or anything that can host static content.


#### Upgrading
When updating to the latest code its important to not only `git pull` the latest from this repo, but to also update
the Node.js modules, and any config files that may have been changed.
* Inside your pool directory (where the init.js script is) do `git pull` to get the latest code.
* Remove the dependencies by deleting the `node_modules` directory with `rm -r node_modules`.
* Run `npm update` to force updating/reinstalling of the dependencies.
* Compare your `config.json` to the latest example ones in this repo or the ones in the setup instructions where each config field is explained. You may need to modify or add any new changes.

### Setting up Testnet

No cryptonote based coins have a testnet mode (yet) but you can effectively create a testnet with the following steps:

* Open `/src/p2p/net_node.inl` and remove lines with `ADD_HARDCODED_SEED_NODE` to prevent it from connecting to mainnet (Monero example: http://git.io/0a12_Q)
* Build the coin from source
* You now need to run two instance of the daemon and connect them to each other (without a connection to another instance the daemon will not accept RPC requests)
  * Run first instance with `./forknoted --p2p-bind-port 28080 --allow-local-ip`
  * Run second instance with `./forknoted --p2p-bind-port 5011 --rpc-bind-port 5010 --add-peer 0.0.0.0:28080 --allow-local-ip`
* You should now have a local testnet setup. The ports can be changes as long as the second instance is pointed to the first instance, obviously

### JSON-RPC Commands from CLI

Documentation for JSON-RPC commands can be found here:
* Daemon https://wiki.bytecoin.org/wiki/Daemon_JSON_RPC_API
* Wallet https://wiki.bytecoin.org/wiki/Bytecoin_RPC_Wallet_API


Curl can be used to use the JSON-RPC commands from command-line. Here is an example of calling `getblockheaderbyheight` for block 100:

```bash
curl 127.0.0.1:18081/json_rpc -d '{"method":"getblockheaderbyheight","params":{"height":100}}'
```


### Monitoring Your Pool

* To inspect and make changes to redis I suggest using [redis-commander](https://github.com/joeferner/redis-commander)
* To monitor server load for CPU, Network, IO, etc - I suggest using [New Relic](http://newrelic.com/)
* To keep your pool node script running in background, logging to file, and automatically restarting if it crashes - I suggest using [forever](https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever)


### Configuring Blockchain Explorer

You need the latest stable version of Forknote for the blockchain explorer - [forknote releases](https://github.com/forknote/forknote/releases)
* Add the following code to the coin's config file:

```
rpc-bind-ip=0.0.0.0
enable-blockexplorer=1
enable-cors=*
```

* Launch forknoted with the corresponding config file
* Change the following line in the pool's frontend config.json:

```
var api_blockexplorer = "http://daemonhost.com:1118";
```
